# gh-cli

This is a tool for interaction with the GitHub APIs.

Currently, this is a quick and dirty implementation to cover my own immediate requirements, which I'll be growing out to cover as much of the functionality as I need/can around my real job :)

Current sub-commands:

* `pr` - gets open PR's for a repo  
* `activity` - Looks up activity for a user on a given repo

TODO: 
- [ ] Switch to os env vars for default repo / org values
- [ ] allow opts for other actions in each API
- [ ] add capability to use API tokens?
- [ ] think of more todo's
